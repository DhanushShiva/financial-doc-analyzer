# Financial Document Analyzer - CrewAI Debug Challenge

A financial document analysis system built with CrewAI that can verify, analyze, and provide investment recommendations for financial documents. This project was part of a debug challenge where the original codebase contained multiple bugs and unrealistic implementations.

## Overview

This system uses AI agents to:
- Verify if uploaded documents are legitimate financial reports
- Analyze financial performance and extract key metrics
- Provide investment recommendations based on document data
- Assess financial risks and suggest mitigation strategies

## Bugs Found and Fixed

### 1. Hallucination-Based Task Descriptions
**Problem**: Original task descriptions instructed agents to "make up" financial data, URLs, and recommendations.
```python
# OLD (buggy)
description="Maybe solve the user's query... feel free to use your imagination... 
             Find some market risks even if there aren't any..."
expected_output="Include at least 5 made-up website URLs that sound financial..."
```
**Fix**: Replaced with realistic, structured analysis tasks focused on actual document content.

### 2. Incorrect Agent Assignment
**Problem**: Verification task was assigned to `financial_analyst` instead of `verifier`.
```python
# OLD (buggy)
verification = Task(
    agent=financial_analyst,  # Wrong agent
    ...
)
```
**Fix**: Corrected to use the appropriate `verifier` agent.

### 3. Unused Tool Imports
**Problem**: `search_tool` was imported but never used in task definitions.
**Fix**: Added `search_tool` to `investment_analysis` task for market context gathering.

### 4. Poor Tool Implementation
**Problem**: `FinancialDocumentTool` had no actual PDF reading capability.
**Fix**: Implemented proper PDF text extraction using PyPDF2 with error handling.

### 5. Missing Main Execution Logic
**Problem**: `main.py` had no proper crew orchestration or task execution.
**Fix**: Created structured execution pipeline with step-by-step analysis flow.

### 6. Inconsistent Expected Outputs
**Problem**: Task descriptions and expected outputs didn't align.
**Fix**: Aligned descriptions with realistic, structured output formats.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-doc-analyzer.git
   cd financial-doc-analyzer
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
The system will automatically analyze the sample Tesla Q2 2025 report:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Custom Document Analysis
To analyze your own financial document:
```python
from main import analyze_custom_document

result = analyze_custom_document(
    file_path="path/to/your/document.pdf",
    query="Analyze quarterly performance"
)
```

### Expected Output
```

## API Components

### Agents
- **Financial Analyst**: Senior analyst with 15+ years experience in financial analysis
- **Document Verifier**: Specialist in document authenticity and completeness verification

### Tasks
- **Document Verification**: Validates if document is legitimate financial report
- **Financial Analysis**: Extracts key metrics and performance indicators
- **Investment Analysis**: Provides buy/hold/sell recommendations
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies and evaluates financial risks

### Tools
- **Financial Document Tool**: Reads and extracts text from PDF/TXT files
- **Search Tool**: Gathers additional market context (simulated for demo)

## Technical Implementation

### Key Features
- **Multi-Agent Workflow**: Sequential processing through specialized agents
- **Document Processing**: PDF text extraction with error handling
- **Structured Output**: Consistent, professional analysis format
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management for file operations

### Dependencies
- `crewai>=0.28.8`: Core AI agent framework
- `PyPDF2>=3.0.1`: PDF text extraction
- `requests>=2.31.0`: HTTP requests for search functionality
- `python-dotenv>=1.0.0`: Environment variable management
- `pydantic>=2.5.0`: Data validation

## Bonus Features (Future Enhancements)

### Queue Worker Model
Could be extended with Celery + Redis for concurrent document processing:
```python
# Example implementation
from celery import Celery

app = Celery('financial_analyzer')
app.config_from_object('celeryconfig')

@app.task
def analyze_document_async(file_path, query):
    return analyze_custom_document(file_path, query)
```

### Database Integration
SQLite/PostgreSQL integration for storing analysis results:
```sql
CREATE TABLE analysis_results (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    document_path TEXT,
    analysis_type TEXT,
    result JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Testing

To test with the sample document:
```bash
python main.py
```

To test with custom documents, place them in the `data/` folder and modify the file path in `main.py`.
